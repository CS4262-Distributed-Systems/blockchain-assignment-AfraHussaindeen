# Blochain concepts

## 1. Smart Contract
Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement or time loss.

## 2. Consensus
These are algorithms that are used to assist nodes in the Blockchain network in reaching an agreement on some validation processes in a set of transactions. There are numerous Algorithms available to accomplish this; for example, Bitcoin, a well-known Blockchain user, employs the Proof-of-work Algorithm to achieve Consensus.
